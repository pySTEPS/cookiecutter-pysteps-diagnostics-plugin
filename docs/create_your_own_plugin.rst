Create your own diagnostic postprocessor plugin
===============================

Since version 1.11, pysteps allows the users to add new diagnostic postprocessors by installing external
packages, called plugins, without modifying the pysteps installation. These plugins need
to follow a particular structure (described next) to allow pysteps to discover and
integrate the new diagnostic postprocessors to the pysteps interface without any user intervention.
For a short description of how the plugins work, see :ref:`how_plugins_work`.
There are two ways of creating your plugin. The first one involves building the plugin
from scratch. An easier alternative is using a Cookiecutter template that easily builds
the skeleton for the new importer plugin.

There are two ways of creating a plugin. The first one is building the diagnostic postprocessor plugin
from scratch. However, an easier alternative is using this `Cookiecutter`_ template
to create the skeleton for the new diagnostic postprocessor plugin, and then customize it.
However, this can be a daunting task if you are creating your first plugin.
Hence, before customizing the cookiecutter template, let's review the main components of
the plugin architecture by describing how to build a diagnostic postprocessor plugin from scratch.

After you are familiar with the plugin fundamentals, you can build your plugin from the
cookiecutter template. For a detailed description of the template, see
:ref:`plugin_template_description`.

Minimal plugin project
----------------------

Let's suppose that we want to add a new diagnostic postprocessor to pysteps. The name of the
diagnostic postprocessor will be denoted as xxx.

Without further ado, let's create a python package  (a.k.a. the plugin) implementing the
diagnostic postprocessor. For simplicity, we will only include the elements that are strictly
needed for the plugin to be installed and to work correctly.

The minimal python package to implement a diagnostic postprocessor plugin has the following
structure:

::

    pysteps-diagnostic-xxx       (project name)
    ├── pysteps_diagnostic_xxx    (package name)
    │  ├── diagnostic_xxx.py  (diagnostic module)
    │  └── __init__.py          (Initialize the pysteps_diagnostic_xxx package)
    ├── setup.py                (Build and installation script)
    └── MANIFEST.in             (manifest template)

Project name
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pysteps-diagnostic-xxx        (project name)

For the project name, our example used the following convention:
**pysteps-diagnostic-<diagnostic short name>**.
Note that this convention is not strictly needed, and any name can be used.

Package name
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pysteps-diagnostic-xxx
    └── pysteps_diagnostic_xxx    (package name)

This is the name of our package containing the new diagnostic postprocessor for pysteps.
The package name should not contain spaces, hyphens, or uppercase letters.
For our example, the package name is **pysteps_diagnostic_xxx**.

\__init__.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pysteps-diagnostic-xxx
        ├── pysteps_diagnostic_xxx
        └───── __init__.py

The __init__.py files are required to inform python that a given directory contains a
python package. This is also the first file executed when the importer plugin
(i.e., the package) is imported.

Importer module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pysteps-diagnostic-xxx
        ├── pysteps_diagnostic_xxx
        └───── diagnostic_xxx.py  (diagnostic module)

Inside the package folder (*pysteps_diagnostic_xxx*), we place the python module
(or modules) containing the actual implementation of our new diagnostic postprocessor.
Below, there is an example of a diagnostic postprocessor module that implements the skeleton of a diagnostic postprocessor:

.. literalinclude:: diagnostic_module_example.py
   :language: python


setup.py
~~~~~~~~

::

    pysteps-diagnostic-xxx       (project name)
    └── setup.py                (Build and installation script)

The `setup.py` file contains all the definitions for building, distributing, and
installing the package. A commented example of a setup.py script used for the plugin
installation is shown next:

.. literalinclude:: example_setup.py
   :language: python


Manifest.in
~~~~~~~~~~~


If you don't supply an explicit list of files, the installation using `setup.py` will
include the minimal files needed for the package to run (the \*.py files, for example).
The Manifest.in file contains the list of additional files and directories to be
included in your source distribution.

Next, we show an example of a Manifest file that containing a README and the LICENSE
files located in the project root. Lines starting with **#** indicate comments, and they
are ignored.

::

    # This file contains the additional files included in your plugin package

    include LICENSE

    include README.rst

    ###You can also add directories with data, tests, etc.
    # recursive-include dir_with_data

    ###Include the documentation directory, if any.
    # recursive-include doc

For more information about the manifest file, see
https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute
